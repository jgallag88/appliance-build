# This script is intended to build an upgrade image that contains all of
# the packages needed to upgrade a particular variant of the appliance,
# whichever platform it is running on. The upgrade image is a tar
# archive whose primary component is an Aptly/APT repository containing
# a version of the delphix-entire package for each supported platform
# and all of its dependencies. This repository is created by taking and
# combining all the deb.tar.gz tarballs produced by live build for this
# variant (of which there will be one per supported platform).

# For upgrade images that we ship to customers, we will need to include

# platform can be time-comsuming though, so for developer convenience,
# here we just take the artifacts from the live-build stage for whatever
# appliance versions were built (making sure that we built for at least
# one platform), and build an upgrade image from that.
